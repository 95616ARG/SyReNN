# PySyReNN: Symbolic Representations for Neural Networks
This package installs the Python client for [SyReNN: Symbolic Representations
for Neural Networks](https://github.com/95616ARG/syrenn).

## Prerequisites
This is only a client library --- you **must** download and run the
corresponding server from [the GitHub
repository](https://github.com/95616ARG/syrenn) before using it. We use
